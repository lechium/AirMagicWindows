# AirMegicWindows
AirMagic client for Windows in C#

This is largely based on the Zeroconf ClientBrowser example (for the bonjour code). Zeroconf is a awesome C# wrapper class for Bonjour that closely resembles the iOS / Mac equivalent classes.

There are some things I would like to incorporate but they aren't my immediate priorities as long as this works. Repeat events being sent for button holds is one of them, and properly managing bonjour instances as they come and leave.

If anyone wants to fork and change these things for me, by all means :)
